# Loan Data Exploration using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting
We are tasked with using statistical and/or machine learning models to gain a deeper understanding of the loan mortgage data made public by Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Our data consists of all the mortgage loan applications filed in Bexar during 2020. Upon researching what others have done with similar datasets, I decided the classic excercise of loan approval classification was not only agreat way to explore the data at hand, but also a perfect opportunity to test the benefits of using a machine learning model like Gradient Boosting for classification in place of statistical logistic regression, while also exploring the drawbacks associated with each.
